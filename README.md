The queries have been decoupled from the excel file since the data source is not mentioned in this repository and the purpose is to demonstrate separately the functionality of gathering data through web scraping, then transforming them using query and excel formulas and creating a dashboard for analysis of the results

The same process could be carried out in an easier way using just Power BI where the Power Query has more capabilities and the data visualization is easier and more powerful, but the purpose was to **create a tool that can be used by anyone that has an Excel license and does not require a Power BI account**

One of the obstacles of using Excel's Power Query is the inability to read some of the web content as tables but this can be by-passed by extracting the data through the HTML code which of course requires more steps

Snippets of the queries are included for demonstration purposes as well as screenshots of the final dashboard and the UI.

** The decision to not include the .xlsm file is due to the work put behind it and the valuable calculations and queries included, while also avoiding sharing macro-enabled workbooks which can be considered harmful for Windows environments**
